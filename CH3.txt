Two days after Harry had first awakened, he was considered healthy enough to start helping around the school. He would have thought building a castle would have proven more challenging, but it was simple work. Salazar would bring the stone, Rowena would give a guideline of where the walls should go, Helga would lay the mortar and Harry would levitate the bricks into place. According to Helga, the rate at which they were laying the stone had nearly doubled from before Harry arrived. The walls would be finished in a few short weeks. After that, they would begin working on the interior.

There was still much to do, for walls did not make a school. There was so much that needed to be added before students arrived. Some of the construction would probably take place in between classes over the next few months. Rather quickly, Salazar had forbidden Harry from making suggestions. “If you ARE from another time,” he reasoned. “Then anything you suggest may alter the timeline. It's best you just help out.”

So Harry just followed what Rowena told him to do. It was mostly placing brick after brick, but it was easy work. He spent a lot of time talking with the ladies as they worked. It was different from reading about them in history books and Hermione’s one-sided discussions about them. He always felt disconnected from them. They were just characters in time. Now, however, he was conversing with them.

“So where’s Godric?” Harry asked one day. “I thought he’d be here.”

Both Helga and Rowena looked at Harry curiously. “Who might that be?” Rowena asked. This had happened a few times, the founders giving Harry odd looks when he mentioned someone or something. Much of their confusion, Harry could understand; Merlin was after their time. But now Harry was confused.

“Godric Gryffindor,” he said, looking up from the brick he was levitating into place. “The other founder of the school.”

The looks of confusion on their faces deepened. “There are no other founders,” Helga stated. She looked worried for Harry. “It was only the three of us until you came along.”

“That can’t be right,” Harry said as his mind fished back to what he knew about this time. “In the history books, it says that he helped build the school. A quarter of the students are in a group named after him.” The looks of confusion on Helga and Rowena’s faces served to confuse him all the more.

“He doesn’t exist,” came Salazar’s voice. He was bringing in a fresh batch of stone for the trio. “He never has, or not as of yet. We have met many people in preparation for the school’s opening and we have not encountered anyone with the name of Gryffindor.”

“But he’s your friend,” Harry argued. “He built the school with you. He’s the reason students even know which group they belong to. He’s the one that convinced you to let muggle-borns attend the school.”

“I don’t know what to tell you,” Salazar said as he guided the floating bricks to the side of the corridor. He leaned against the wall to rest. Helga and Rowena seemed ready for a rest, too. “Before you came here, we had no help. The three of us built the majority of the castle ourselves. We are willing to select the students for each house ourselves. I don’t know why I would say muggle-borns aren’t allowed here. I will say this, though. If you want a Godric Griffin, then you  have to take up the mantle yourself.”

“That’s absurd,” Harry replied, wondering how there couldn’t be a Godric. “You’d be asking me to take up the role of one of the most powerful and knowledgeable people in history. I’m only twenty years old.”

“Well, you are rather knowledgeable,” Helga said. “That is if you are from another time. I’m still not entirely convinced. In any case, if you are, and if there’s no Godric Gryffindor, then it makes sense that you would be him.”

Harry was starting to get a headache. When they started recruiting professors, they would finally meet the real Godric.

Later, Helga had gone off to assist the house-elves with dinner. She enjoyed cooking and, unlike many other magicals, loves to cook along with them. Rowena and Salazar were going over the castle’s plans and Harry was trying to make sense of things. For years, he had learned of Godric and the other founders. They were four friends that had decided to Start a school together. They built the castle together. They taught together. Didn’t they? If Godric wasn’t here, then he must have come to the school later. Or it was someone that had taken the name.

Lost in thought, Harry didn’t notice Rowena approaching him. “He trusts you more than he lets on,” She said, handing harry a goblet of wine. “Salazar does. While he has his doubts about you being from so long in the future, he knows you believe you are.” She stood nearby and gazed out the window as well. “He won’t admit this, but he’s afraid you being right. If you are, then that means our lives are set in stone. You will already know our futures and nothing we do will change that.”

“I don’t know about that,” Harry said. “For nine years, we learned about the founders in class. Always, we were told about four founders. Then I get here and find that one of them never existed. If that doesn’t show that history can change, I don’t know what does.”

“He doesn’t see it like that,” she said. “The way he sees it, you’re either the fourth founder you spoke of or-”

“Out of my mind,” Harry interrupted. “I’ve seen the way you three look at me. Like you think I’m about to have a fit or something.”

“You have to see it from our point of view,” Rowena replied, slightly taken aback. “A man we have never seen before showed up and started saying he was from the future. Then goes on to talk about us as historical figures. You then went on to tell us all about a friend of ours we had never heard of. It’s not that we want to think you unstable, it’s just that the alternative is,” She paused. “Terrifying.”

“I can see that,” Harry said, still not looking up. “But from my perspective, I lived my whole life this far. I went to school, courted girls. I fought in a war! I’m supposed to be married in a few months and even have a three-year-old godson. If none of that was real, then who am I? Is my whole life a lie?”

Rowena didn’t know how to respond to that. “I don’t know, Harry,” she said. “But whatever the truth is, we’ll be there for you.”

The next day was set to be a big one. It would be the first time a student ever steps foot inside Hogwarts. The students, their parents, and several of the professors would get to tour the school and the grounds. There was still much to do before the term started, but the walls were built and three floors were almost completely furnished.

More students showed up than he had expected. While it was a far cry from the three hundred students that attended alongside Harry, but there were still around a hundred or so, ranging in age from eleven to fifteen. According to Salazar, at sixteen, people were usually sent off to work. They all gathered in what would one day be the clock tower courtyard. Students and parents alike were looking around with wide eyes, taking everything in.

“I am pleased you were all able to make it,” Salazar said from the stairs. “In just a few moments, we will head into the school and you can see where the next generation of witches and wizards will learn about magic, what it is, and how to use it. But first, we have a few words.

“For generations, our children have been educated, not in any school, but by our parents and their parents… now, a new era dawns, where parents may rest assured that their children will have the best education that our society can give. A structured curriculum will be followed so that students are able to retain the information passed to them. Rather than have one person teach  many topics, we plan to have separate professors that specialize in one area. An area they are able to teach well.

“In the beginning, we will only teach a few core subjects, but as the school grows in size, more subjects will be added. This year’s subjects will include charms, transfiguration, history of magic, potions, runes, plant studies,  and, as an elective, wizarding and muggle etiquette. This may seem  like a heavy course load for some, but the courses will be broken down into shorter segments.”

 

Salazar then told them how the school had come to be. He left out the part of Rowena’s dreams but told of coming across this location. 

After a few minutes of talking, he led the crowd in.
